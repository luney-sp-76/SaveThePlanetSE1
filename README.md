# OUR_TEAM_PROJECT
Java Project based on the game "Save The Planet"<br>
[Have a look at The Original Game!!](https://www.appropedia.org/Save_the_planet_board_game#:~:text=Save%20The%20Planet%20Board%20Game%20is%20free%20and%20open%2Dsource,the%20planet%20in%20real%20life)

The requirements for the game will be as follows:<br>

1. The  game  has  up  to  four  players,  and  their  names  should  be  entered  at  the  beginning  of  the gameplay.<br>

2. The players take turns. They throw two virtual dice at a time during their turn.<br>

3. Players  are  told  where  they  have  landed  and  their  obligations  or  opportunities.  Then,  where appropriate,  they  may  indicate  their  choice  of  action.  
For  example,  dedicating  some  of  their resources may ‘take charge’ of a square no one else owns. If a player lands on a square no one owns,  but  they  don’t  want  to  take  charge  of  it  themselves,  it  may  be  offered  at  the  usual  cost  to another player.<br>

4. If a player’s resources have changed, the system indicates the reason for the change and announces 
the player’s new ‘balance’ (e.g. the ‘funds’ or ‘credits’ that are still available).<br>

5. There is a start square, where players pick up their ‘resources’ (it’s your choice what the ‘resources’ 
represent – and you should be inventive with the square’s name – this is the equivalent of a ‘Collect 
X as you pass Go’ square). Next, there is a square on the board where nothing happens – again, 
you decide what it is called in your game.<br>   

6. There are four ‘fields’, two consisting of three ‘areas’ and two consisting of two ‘areas’ respectively. 
A number of related areas form a ‘field’ in Save Our Planet. You decide what the fields are called 
and what they represent.   For example, Renewable Energy might be a ‘field’.    Different areas make 
up a field: Hydroelectricity might be an area in the field of Renewable Energy [say it out loud, and 
see if it makes sense!]. You decide what the fields are in your game and what areas they will include. 
One of the two-area fields is the most costly field on the board to acquire and resource; another two-
area field is the least costly field to acquire and resource.<br>

7. Before you can develop an area within a field, you must own/manage/’be in charge of’ (you decide 
what ‘custodianship’ means!) the whole field – and on your turn you can develop an area in a field 
that you already own even if you are not positioned on that area.<br>

8. Decide what development is called, what it represents, and how much it costs in your game; others 
might have to pay you or invest in it to use it. (Again, you decide the nature and the significance of 
the transactions between players.)  Three ‘developments’ are needed before you can establish (and 
pay for, or otherwise ‘resource’) the equivalent of a ‘major development’ (again, you decide what this 
represents and what it costs).<br>

9. Not only is there a cost associated with developing areas within fields: when you land on an area 
but do not ‘own’ it yourself, you have to give up some of your resources for it – the more developed 
the area, the greater the resource consumed.<br>

10. Decide what happens when one player runs out of resources. Are they the winner or the loser? It’s 
your choice.    If one player no longer wants to play, the game ends. In both cases (no resources 
left; not wanting to play), the amount of resource each player holds is shown. There is no need to 
convert ‘developments’, etc., to an equivalent value in your ‘resource units’. Find forms of words that 
express the outcome of the game in a manner appropriate to the overall style of your version of Save 
Our Planet. Is winning a matter of amassing resources from other players, or should our Save-Our-Planet hero be aiming to give all that they have (and more) to support the worthy ventures of a fellow 
eco-warrior?<br>
